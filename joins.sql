-- STEP 1:Creste a new Database
CREATE DATABASE JoinsPractice;
USE JoinsPractice;
 
 -- STEP 2:Create Students table
 CREATE TABLE Students(

  -- STEP 2:Create Courses table
  CREATE TABLE Courses (

-- STEP 4: Insert sample data into Students
INSERT INTO Students (StuID, Name, CourseID) VALUES
(1, 'Anjali', 101),

-- STEP 5: Insert sample data into Courses
INSERT INTO  Courses (CourseID, CourseName) VALUES

-- INNER JOIN: Students with matching Course IDs in Courses table
SELECT Students.Name, Courses.CourseName

-- LEFT JOIN: Show all students, even if they don't have a matching course
SELECT Students.Name, Courses.CourseName

-- RIGHT JOIN: Show all courses, even if no student is enrolled in them
SELECT Students.Name, Courses.CourseName

-- FULL OUTER JOIN: Combine all students and all courses
-- Since MySQL doesnâ€™t support FULL OUTER JOIN, use UNION
